# Coffee Machine

A project for the JetBrains Academy.

## About

The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, water and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## Available commands

- Buy - to buy a given cup of coffee
- Fill - add supplies to the coffee machine
- Remaining - check remaining amount of supplies
- Take - withdraw all available money from the machine
